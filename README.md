# jsTodo
simple todo lists

A webpage that stores your todo lists.

Currently, they are persisted in the localStorage, meaning they are not very portable. Anyway, simple export and import functions are provided.

If I use this 'tool' for myself more extensively, additions will be made.


Stuff that's working:
- create new lists
- add items to a list
- mark items done by clicking on them
- delete lists
- persist changes in localStorage
- export all lists (as JSON)
- import JSON
